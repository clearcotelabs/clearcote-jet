"""Where the browser may go: only to web addresses (http and https), and not to this machine, the local network or a
cloud metadata endpoint.

The same guard as the Clearcote MCP server (clearcote-mcp, clearcote_mcp/_egress.py); keep the two in step.

Two layers, one rule:

* check_url() judges a url a tool is given, read the way the browser will read it (WHATWG URL rules: tabs and
  newlines dropped, backslashes and missing slashes after http:, userinfo, percent-encoded and full-width hosts, IPv4
  written as one number or in hex or octal or with parts left out, IPv6 with an IPv4 address inside). Only http and
  https pass, always: file:, view-source:, chrome:, devtools:, about:, data: and every other scheme are refused, with
  or without the opt-in below.
* guard_context() puts the same check on every request the browser makes in the context (navigations, images,
  frames, scripts' requests, popups), on the url as the browser itself has canonicalised it, and on every redirect
  a page follows (Playwright continues a redirect's next request without asking its routes, so each page also gets a
  CDP session that holds 3xx answers until their Location is judged). Requests that never leave the browser pass:
  data: and blob: urls, about:blank and about:srcdoc (pages are made of them, and every new tab starts on
  about:blank). Every other scheme that is not http(s) is refused (file:, chrome:, chrome-extension:, devtools:,
  filesystem:, ftp: ...); ws: and wss: are judged by their host. The browser itself already refuses to let a web
  page load or open file:, chrome: and devtools: urls (and a redirect to one), so the tools' urls are the way there
  that this guard closes.

An address is refused when it is in a non-public range (BLOCKED_V4 / BLOCKED_V6, IPv4 inside IPv6 checked as IPv4),
when its name is localhost or a metadata name, or when the name resolves to any such address.

What it cannot close:
* DNS rebinding: a name is resolved here and again by the browser a moment later; a name that answers with a public
  address first and a private one second still gets through. Verdicts are not cached, which keeps the window small,
  not closed.
* WebSockets: Playwright can only route them by replacing the page's WebSocket object in JavaScript, which this
  browser does not do; a page script can still open a ws:// connection to a private address.
* With a proxy, the proxy resolves names: a name that resolves differently there is judged by the local answer.
* A popup (or any page the site opens) gets its redirect check when it appears, so a redirect in its very first load
  can come before the check is in place; the page's first request itself is always checked. Redirects of requests
  made inside workers or cross-site frames are not held either.
Routing every request also makes Playwright turn the browser's HTTP cache off for the context, and each response is
held for a moment until it is judged.

CLEARCOTE_JET_ALLOW_PRIVATE_EGRESS=1 (or clearcote-mcp's CLEARCOTE_ALLOW_PRIVATE_EGRESS=1) allows private addresses
(local development servers): the tools' urls are then checked for their scheme only, and the browser's requests are
not routed (so its HTTP cache stays on).
